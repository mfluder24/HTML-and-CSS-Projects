	<p>Poncho's favourite place to go is the beach. <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/welsh-corgi-facts-thumbnail-3.jpg">Many corgis love the beach.</a></p>
	<p>Here is what the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America says about the orgins of the Pembroke:</p>
	<blockquote cite="http://pwcca.org/about-pembrokes/">Legend has it that the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an "enchanted" dog, and certainly this must be true! 'Tis said he was used by the fairies and elves of Wales to pull fairy coaches, work fairy cattle, and serve as a steed for the fairy warriors. Even today those people with keen eyes and understanding hearts may see the marks of the "fairy saddle" in the coat over the shoulders.</blockquote>
